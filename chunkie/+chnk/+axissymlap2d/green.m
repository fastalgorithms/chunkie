%
% CHNK.AXISSYMHELM2D.GREEN evaluate the Laplace green's function
% for the given sources and targets. 
%
% Note: that the first coordinate is r, and the second z.
% The code relies on precomputed tables and hence loops are required for 
% computing various pairwise interactions.
% Finally, the code is not efficient in the sense that val, grad, hess 
% are always internally computed independent of nargout
%
% Since the kernels are not translationally invariant in r, the size
% of the gradient is 3, for d/dr, d/dr', and d/dz
